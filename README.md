# synthwave-notepad-plusplus
This is a synthwave-inspired theme for Notepad++. If you don't know what that is, [look no further](https://synthspiria.com/en/everything-about-synthwave/).

This theme is based on https://github.com/robb0wen/synthwave-vscode, but without the cool glowing effects.


### Prerequisites

You just need Notepad++ installed on your system.

### Installing

After downloading Synthwave.xml, copy it to the following directory:

```
%APPDATA%\Notepad++\themes
```
